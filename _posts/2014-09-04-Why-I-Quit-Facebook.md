### Waiting for a trigger

I was super super active on fb. I could not resist my self from not sharing anything remotely interesting. I like to poke others on their posts and find out flaws in the what others write. It used to take 3-4 hours of my day easily. I used to hate this. I always wanted to get out of facebook, but could not because there is no push and was a little scared of losing out many contacts.

### Here comes the trigger

[My question on FB forums on what happened](https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=1486991664886971)
>On 27th august while playing around with FB's official android app, I clicked something and all my work contacts (includes
>mailing lists, CEO, CTO and a never ending list of contacts in my mail) got invites to facebook from me.
>
>I thought this was over. But again on 12 Sept without any action from my side the same happened again. This time facebook sent reminders to the same contacts to connect with me. 
>
>
>This is super lame. Do you seriously expect people to join fb by doing this? Anyway past is past. I deleted that account and removed the android app (as that is how facebook got access to my work contacts).
>
>How do I make sure that facebook does not send invites on my behalf?

All of a sudden I was the hot lunch table discussion in my company! I thought that was the time to get out of fb and I got out.

### Happily ever after

Now to people in my company, I introduce myself as the guy who spammed using facebook! Im loving life without facebook. It feels like I found inner peace now!
