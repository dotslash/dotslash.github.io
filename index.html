If you are wondering what yesteapea means, here you go. <code>Sai Teja Pratap => STP => Yes Tea Pea.</code> I work for <a href="https://www.relcy.com">Relcy, Inc</a> mostly on backend computing and search ranking infrastrcuture. Before that I used to work for <a href="http://rocketfuel.com/" target="_blank">Rocket Fuel, Inc.</a>. Before that I was doing my Bachelors in <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">Computer Science at IIT Bombay</a> </p>
        <p>This webpage is created just for the sake of it as I did not know what to put on the home page. (This is certainly better than an empty homepage which was my initial plan). Now that you are here, checkout something which might be of interest. </p>
